# Dashboard Project Description
The dashboard is a multi-purpose desktop app. It allows me to launch any frequently used desktop app in one click and includes a To-Do-List making it easy for me to keep track of what needs to be done. 

I created this app using `NodeJS`, `ElectronJS`, `ReactJS`, `ExpressJS`, and `MongoDB`.

While working on this project, I gained a better understanding of `ElectronJS`, `ExpressJS` and `MongoDB`.

I plan to continue to work on and improve this Dashboard in the future.
